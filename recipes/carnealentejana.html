    <h2>Açorda</h2>
        <p>Carne de Porco à Alentejana (Pork with clams) is one of the most traditional and popular pork dishes of Portuguese cuisine. 
            It is a combination of pork and clams, with potatoes and coriander. Usually, about 800 g of pork are marinated for some time in white 
            wine, paprika, red pepper paste, chopped garlic, coriander, bay leaf, and salt and white pepper. Cumin is often added in northern Portugal 
            as well. It is then fried until golden brown, when clams are added and cooked. Traditionally, this dish is served with cubed potato fries or 
            baked potatoes.</p>

        <p>Its origin is uncertain, the name would appear to be from Ribatejo, but this is disputed by some, who give its roots to the Alverca. 
            The reason behind it are the clams, who are much more popular in seaside towns rather than places far from the ocean, like the majority 
            of Alentejo who only has one sizeable fishing port, Sines, and small fishing villages on the coast, and has a mainly meat-based cuisine. 
            It may be an example of fusion cuisine between pork dishes of inner Alentejo and seafood dishes of coastal Algarve.</p>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season pork all over with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and place in a large ziplock plastic bag. 
                        Smash 3 garlic cloves, and add to bag with wine, bay leaves, and Pimentón. Seal and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove pork from marinade, and pat dry. Remove and discard garlic and bay leaves; reserve remaining marinade. 
                        Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add half of pork, and cook, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, 
                        about 5 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate. Repeat with remaining half of pork. Chop remaining 3 garlic cloves, and add to Dutch oven with onion 
                        and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil; cook, stirring often, until golden, about 6 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, red pepper, and reserved 
                        marinade</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring often, 3 minutes. Return cooked pork to Dutch oven; stir in 1 cup stock until 
                        pork is mostly submerged. Cover and bake in preheated oven until pork is fork-tender, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Stir in potatoes and remaining 1 cup stock. Cover and bake until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Transfer Dutch oven to stovetop over high, and add clams. Cover and cook until clams open, 3 to 5 minutes. (Remove and discard any unopened clams.) 
                        Season with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with lemon wedges and crusty bread.</li>
