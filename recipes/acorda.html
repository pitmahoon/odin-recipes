        <p>Açorda is a typical Portuguese dish composed of thinly sliced bread with garlic, finely chopped coriander, olive oil, vinegar, water, 
            white pepper, salt and poached eggs. Throughout Portugal, Açordas have significant variations, most notably in the Alentejo, where an 
            Açorda, also called Açorda Alentejana, can be considered a soup, whereas in other regions of Portugal it has a consistency similar to 
            a bread paste. Other variations can have shrimps or codfish.</p>
        <p>The eggs are poached in salted water. Garlic, coriander and salt are "mashed" into a coarse paste, olive oil and vinegar are added in, and 
            then the mixture is poured over the bread. The eggs are then placed over the bread and the water used to poach them, with chicken stock, is 
            poured over. The açorda is then left to steam for a few minutes. The final dish usually has a bright green flare.</p>
